**Annual Maintenance Fees**

Whether you lease, lease-to-own, or purchase your KeeperVault build outright, an annual maintenance fee will always apply. This is not a hidden cost — it’s the foundation of continuity and protection.

Your annual fee covers all system maintenance, performance checks, and version integrity updates. It also includes structural expansion and refinement.  
If your company grows, adds new departments, or decides to integrate additional Core Pillars, there is **no extra charge** for those expansions. You have already purchased the Vault — therefore you have access to everything within it. Simply contact Daisy, and she will coordinate your update request with our build team. Every new integration is installed with care, precision, and full verification before deployment.

The annual maintenance fee also grants access to the **KeeperVault Neighborhood Watch Program** — the global defense network that protects every Vault installation in real time.  
If a cyber threat or exploit is detected anywhere in the world, Home Base immediately creates and deploys a patch across all active Vaults. This happens *before* the threat can reach your system.*

Neighborhood Watch is the **only** automatic update KeeperVault performs.  
All other maintenance actions are manually coordinated and verified through Home Base.

This annual structure ensures your Vault remains resilient, current, and fully protected — online and offline simultaneously — just as it was designed to be.
