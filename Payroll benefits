💰 Payroll — Core Pillar Overview

Purpose:
KeeperVault’s Payroll Pillar automates compensation with precision, transparency, and total security — protecting both employer and employee through encrypted records, biometric verification, and complete offline capability. It ensures that every dollar is accounted for, every hour verified, and every record tamper-proof.

Core Benefits:

Biometric Time Validation: Confirms every timecard entry, clock-in, or approval through fingerprint or biometric scan — eliminating “buddy punching” and falsified hours.

Automated Pay Cycle Management: Calculates gross pay, deductions, benefits, and taxes automatically, following your organization’s defined schedule.

Encrypted Recordkeeping: Stores all payroll data locally — no cloud, no external APIs — ensuring confidentiality and compliance with audit requirements.

Integrated Benefits Tracking: Syncs seamlessly with HR to manage health, retirement, and supplemental benefits without duplicate data entry.

Audit & History Logging: Maintains permanent, tamper-proof records for wage history, pay adjustments, and bonus allocations with timestamped proof.

Error Prevention Engine: Flags anomalies in hours, pay rates, or deductions before processing — protecting against costly mistakes.

Offline Assurance: Continues payroll processing even without internet access, syncing safely once reconnection is restored.


Why It Matters:
Payroll is trust made tangible.
KeeperVault ensures that compensation is handled with precision, integrity, and accountability — every time, without fail.
