⚠️ Emergency Preparedness — Core Pillar Overview

Why It’s Here:

Emergency Preparedness is placed right alongside Cybersecurity and Physical Security because in the real world, danger doesn’t wait its turn.
When disaster strikes — fire, flood, shooter, gas leak, grid failure — it hits everything at once.
A firewall won’t save a life. A locked door won’t treat a wound.
That’s why KeeperVault positions Preparedness as the third leg of the defense triangle — not reaction, but readiness.
Because when you’ve got seconds to respond, the system better already know what to do.

💡 6. Power Failure Protocol

Syncs with Power & Utility Pillar to manage backup systems: generators, battery storage, solar fallback.

Verifies generator runtime capacity, fuel type, switch-over delay time.

Monitors UPS (uninterrupted power supply) thresholds for servers, medical devices, comms, and refrigeration.

Includes Cold Chain Protection Mode for facilities storing food, medicine, or vaccines.

📡 7. Comms Contingency

Preloads contact trees, SMS templates, satellite comm fallback numbers, and HAM radio relay instructions.

Stores printable emergency signal sheets for non-verbal or low-tech communication.

🧬 8. Critical Function Preservation

Flags the systems that must stay running — life support, server vaults, refrigeration, security feed, etc.
