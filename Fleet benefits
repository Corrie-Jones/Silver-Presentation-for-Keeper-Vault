🔧 Fleet — Core Pillar Overview

Purpose:
Fleet is the mechanical backbone of movement.
It controls, verifies, and documents every operational vehicle — from loaders and service trucks to drones, forklifts, and specialized ground assets.

Core Systems & Safeguards:

1. VaultLock Ignition Control — Every vehicle ignition tied to biometric or passcode verification. Unauthorized starts trigger full lockdown.


2. Maintenance Chain Integration — Real-time feed from Heavy Equipment Maintenance schedules; overdue assets auto-flagged “grounded.”


3. Lifecycle Ledger — Immutable chain of mileage, service hours, and replacement parts. Each update hash-sealed and timestamped.


4. Operator Certification Index — Drivers, mechanics, and techs linked by ID and credentials; unverified users denied system entry.


5. Fuel & Efficiency Monitor — Tracks usage, idle time, and route economy; data routed to Finance and Sustainability Pillars.


6. Incident Auto-Record — Cameras, sensors, and onboard VaultBots record all anomalies — collisions, tampering, or system alerts.


7. Emergency Recall Protocol — Keeper-level command can recall, freeze, or reroute any active vehicle instantly.


8. Offline Continuity Node — Each unit carries a mini-Vault brain ensuring logs, maps, and diagnostics survive total network loss.



Why It Matters:
Fleet isn’t about ownership; it’s about readiness and proof.
KeeperVault turns every piece of mobile machinery into a self-verifying record — trusted, secured, and recoverable even in blackout conditions.
