⚙️ SECRETARIAL — Core Overview

Purpose:
The Secretarial Pillar is the coordination center of every organization — the bridge between management, staff, and operations.
KeeperVault strengthens this foundation by automating communication flow, protecting sensitive correspondence, and creating verifiable records of all business communication.

Divided into two synchronized systems — Executive and Administrative — this pillar ensures that leadership communication and daily clerical processes work in perfect rhythm.
Every memo, message, and record is encrypted, time-stamped, and traceable.

No lost notes. No missed directives. No unverified communication.
