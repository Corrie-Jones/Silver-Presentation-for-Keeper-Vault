⚖️ ETHICS & INTERNAL AFFAIRS — Core Overview

Purpose:
KeeperVault’s Ethics & Internal Affairs Pillar protects an organization from its most silent threats — not the external kind, but the internal.
It ensures that fairness, accountability, and truth remain constants, no matter who is in charge.

This Pillar doesn’t exist to control people — it exists to document integrity.
Every review, investigation, or ethical decision is sealed in verifiable proof — timestamped, encrypted, and stored without bias or interference.
When questions arise, the record speaks for itself.

KeeperVault turns integrity into evidence and trust into architecture.
