🕊️ ETHICS

Purpose:
Ethics defines the standards by which every action is judged.
This section ensures that moral and regulatory expectations are clear, accessible, and permanently verified.

What It Does

Centralizes codes of conduct, compliance rules, and employee acknowledgments.

Tracks all revisions and approvals with timestamped, immutable logs.

Allows staff to securely access and sign required policies from any verified device.

Creates automatic alerts for outdated, missing, or unsigned documents.

Integrates directly with HR, Legal, and Compliance to confirm alignment.

Generates ready-to-present audit summaries for regulators or leadership.

Why It Matters

Ethics is the invisible layer of protection that prevents reputational damage and legal exposure.
KeeperVault preserves that layer — not through policy statements, but through provable history.

“A company’s integrity is only as strong as its record of it.”
