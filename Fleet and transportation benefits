⚙️ Fleet & Transportation — Core Overview

Purpose:
KeeperVault unites Fleet and Transportation beneath one command framework — the system of movement and proof.
Fleet governs machines of motion.
Transportation governs the paths they travel.

Both operate through the same verification spine: no engine turns, and no route opens, without authenticated clearance from the Vault.
Together, they ensure that movement itself remains accountable — mechanical integrity, lawful operation, and traceable delivery — under both physical and digital command.

How It Works:
When you enter this chamber, you’ll find two adjoining gateways:

Fleet Chamber — physical control of all vehicles, assets, and service chains.

Transportation Chamber — command over routing, dispatch, manifests, and logistics.


They act independently yet synchronize continuously through Operations, Maintenance, and Security Pillars.
Every mile is logged, every transfer notarized, every delay recorded for trace and proof.

⚖️ Continuity Doctrine

Fleet & Transportation together form KeeperVault’s Doctrine of Motion Integrity — the assurance that what moves can always be proven, recalled, and restored.

No vehicle departs without service clearance.
No cargo arrives without signature.
No command executes without verification.

“Movement with KeeperVault is not travel — it’s testimony.”
