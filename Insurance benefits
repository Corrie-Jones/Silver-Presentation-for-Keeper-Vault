🛡️ Insurance — Core Pillar Overview

Purpose:
KeeperVault’s Insurance Pillar safeguards every facet of your operation — workforce, property, liability, and continuity — under one governed framework.
It removes uncertainty from the claims process, centralizes policy management, and preserves every document, adjustment, and communication inside your encrypted environment.

Core Benefits:

Unified Policy Command Center: Consolidates all active policies — health, liability, property, worker’s compensation, and equipment — into one secure dashboard.

Proof-of-Coverage Archive: Maintains permanent, locally stored verification copies of every certificate, renewal, and adjustment for audit protection.

Claims Lifecycle Management: Tracks every claim from initiation through resolution — including attachments, correspondence, and settlements — without ever exposing data to outside servers.

Cross-Pillar Integration: Syncs directly with HR (for employee coverage), Finance (for premium payments), and Legal (for liability and dispute records).

Renewal & Expiration Alerts: Automatically signals administrators ahead of lapses or pending policy renewals to ensure continuous protection.

Disaster Response Sync: Activates alongside Emergency Preparedness protocols, ensuring all insurance documentation and proof-of-loss data remain available even offline.

Encrypted Adjuster Access: Allows limited, monitored access for external agents through temporary biometric verification only.

Offline Continuity: Operates fully during power or network loss; policies and claims remain accessible until safe reconnection.


Why It Matters:
Insurance is not just coverage — it’s confidence.
KeeperVault transforms policy management into a discipline of readiness, ensuring that when disaster strikes, the proof, the protection, and the plan are already in your hands.
