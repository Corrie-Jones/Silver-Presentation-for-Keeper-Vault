Some people still ask if KeeperVault is for sale.

It isn’t.

KeeperVault isn’t a product you buy —  
it’s a framework you build *within.*

Every client receives a sealed, self-contained system —  
built for your mission, your infrastructure, your level of clearance.  
But the Vault itself — the framework, the moral core, the architecture —  
remains protected.

You’re not buying my company.  
You’re not buying my code.  
You’re commissioning your own custom build,  
anchored inside a system that can’t be compromised, copied, or sold.

That’s how we guarantee integrity —  
for defense, for hospitals, for grids, for everyone who still believes  
some things should never be for sale.

You don’t purchase the Vault.  
You entrust your build to it.

And there are three ways to do that:

1️⃣ **Lease Annually** — Perfect for agencies or divisions that want access and updates without long-term lock-in.  
2️⃣ **Lease-to-Own** — For organizations building long-term continuity, this allows full transition of your build into permanent control after the term concludes.  
3️⃣ **Buy Custom Build** — For those who know exactly what they need. You own your build, your data, your configuration — but the KeeperVault Core remains protected.

All KeeperVault builds — whether leased, leased-to-own, or purchased outright —  
carry a **one-time activation fee** and **annual maintenance fee**.  
This ensures your system stays fully updated, protected, and operational —  
online *and* offline, year after year.
