KEEPERVAULT MILITARY-GRADE KEY — TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION (REFERENCE)

Overview
--------
Type: Rugged cryptographic hardware key (USB-C primary; optional legacy USB-A adapter for backward compatibility)
Primary use: Secure deployment and attestation device for KeeperVault builds, carrying the core encryption, authentication, and continuity protocols required for simultaneous online/offline operation.

Hardware
--------
- Form factor: Rugged USB-C device (approx. 80 × 24 × 12 mm) with reinforced housing and tether loop.
- Weight: ~65–90 g depending on enclosure.
- Housing: Aircraft-grade aluminum or stainless steel outer shell with internal EMP-shielded Faraday cavity and anti-tamper epoxy.
- Connector: USB-C (reversible, MIL-grade mechanical spec). Optional USB-A adapter for legacy systems if required.
- Environmental rating: IP68 — dust-tight and immersion-rated (up to 1.5 m for 30 min).
- Operating temperature: −40 °C to +85 °C.
- Shock & vibration: Built to MIL-STD-810H profiles (shock, vibration, temperature cycling).
- EMI/EMC: Designed to MIL-STD-461 limits for electromagnetic immunity.
- EMP protection: Multi-layer Faraday shielding and transient suppression on I/O lines (resists high-altitude EMP and surge events).

Security (crypto & certification targets)
-----------------------------------------
- Secure Element: Hardware security module (HSM/SE) — keys generated and stored internally, never exportable.  
- FIPS 140-3 (Level 3) and Common Criteria EAL4+ certification targets.
- Algorithms:
   • AES-256-GCM for encryption  
   • ECC P-384 (NIST P-384) or RSA-4096 for signatures  
   • SHA-256/384 for integrity  
   • HKDF/PBKDF2 for key derivation
- Key management: On-device non-extractable root; per-deployment derived keys; signed attestation certificates (X.509).
- Authentication: PIN + optional biometric token handshake; progressive lockout after repeated failures.
- Secure boot & firmware: Digitally signed firmware; locked bootloader; only KeeperVault-signed updates accepted.
- Auto-update policy: **No automatic updates** except the Neighborhood Watch security patch system.

Tamper & physical security
--------------------------
- Conductive mesh and epoxy potting for critical circuits.
- Microswitch detection for physical tampering → automatic key wipe.
- Anti-probe coatings and obfuscated internal layout.
- Encrypted storage for manifests and signed logs (immutable audit chain).

Performance & capacities
------------------------
- Encrypted storage: 8 – 32 MB for manifests, keys, and logs.
- AES-256 hardware acceleration; ECC P-384 sign/verify < 20 ms typical.
- Signed rolling log of up to 10 000 events.

Interfaces & integration
------------------------
- Host support: PKCS#11 / PIV / CTAP2 / KeeperVault CLI integration shim.
- **Simultaneous online and offline operation:**  
  The Key functions in both lanes at once, maintaining encrypted continuity without transferring private key material externally.
- When connected to authorized systems, it can verify authenticity, deliver signed manifests, and receive approved Neighborhood Watch security patches — all within KeeperVault’s encrypted dual-lane channel.

Supply chain & lifecycle
------------------------
- Provisioned with factory attestation and per-client enrollment through Daisy.
- Each key carries a serial ID and revocation profile; lost or compromised keys are invalidated via Neighborhood Watch.
- Decommissioning: full cryptographic wipe and physical destruction.

Policy summary
--------------
The KeeperVault Key is a hardened device designed to enforce local sovereignty over your build.  
It never leaks data, never yields to remote control, and operates online and offline simultaneously — exactly as KeeperVault was meant to.  

It protects what you built, defends what you own, and stands watch even when the grid goes dark.
