Encrypted Ledgers: Every entry is locally stored and timestamped — immune to tampering, deletion, or outside interference.

Cross-Pillar Synchronization: Works seamlessly with Payroll, HR, Inventory, and Compliance for unified financial integrity.

Expense Verification: Uses biometric or managerial sign-off to verify every expenditure before release.

Automated Reconciliation: Matches transactions against bank records, invoices, and purchase orders to eliminate human error.
