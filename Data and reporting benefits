📊 DATA & REPORTING — Core Overview (Plaque)

The **Data & Reporting Pillar** is KeeperVault’s lens of clarity. It captures, secures, and transforms raw input into strategic intelligence — connecting every pillar through numbers, logs, dashboards, and truth.

**Data** ensures everything is measured and stored at the source: clean, verifiable, encrypted, and offline-capable.  
**Reporting** then turns that raw data into visual dashboards, trend analysis, and leadership insight — showing not only what's happening, but why it's happening and where it's heading.

Together, they eliminate guesswork, automate decision tools, and empower every department with the information they need — when they need it — even without internet access.

“Truthful data. Trusted reports. Real-time clarity, built into every Vault.”
