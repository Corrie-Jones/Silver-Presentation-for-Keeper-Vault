🛡️ INTERNAL AFFAIRS

Purpose:
Internal Affairs converts oversight into a verifiable process.
It replaces rumors with records and ensures that every concern, claim, or investigation follows a transparent chain of command.

What It Does

Accepts and encrypts reports through anonymous or named intake channels.

Logs every interaction and edit under a unique, non-deletable signature.

Assigns tiered review access to protect both evidence and individuals.

Tracks investigation progress from intake through resolution.

Locks completed case files, preserving evidence for internal or legal use.

Cross-links with HR, Legal, and Compliance for collaborative review.

Enables authorized oversight boards or auditors to view sealed summaries.

Operates locally or offline in secure environments without risk of data loss.

Why It Matters

Without proof, justice can’t exist.
KeeperVault’s Internal Affairs module ensures that truth remains accessible — protected from manipulation, omission, or erasure.
It provides organizations with the confidence that every issue is handled fairly, and that the record will always outlast opinion.

“Truth doesn’t fade when it’s written in stone.
