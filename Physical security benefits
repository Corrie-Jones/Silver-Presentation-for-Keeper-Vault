🛡️ Physical Security

Core Pillar ⚙️ Mission

If someone can walk through your door, none of it matters.

KeeperVault’s Physical Security locks down the real-world perimeter.
We use your existing locks, doors, windows, fences, vehicles, and buildings — and map them into a working command structure that prevents, monitors, and responds to breaches in real time.

Whether it's a swinging gate or a biometric scanner, a padlock or a push bar, we chart it, track it, and seal it.

🧱 STRUCTURAL HARDENING – Using What You Already Own

1. Doors

We record every door’s type and locking mechanism:

Manual deadbolt, auto-lock, maglock, keypad, RFID, timed entry, etc.

KeeperVault designates:

🟣 Standard Entry Doors

🔴 Restricted Access Points

🔵 Emergency Escape Routes

Lockdown Capabilities:

If electronically controlled: can be sealed instantly from Command.

If manual: triggers a lockdown protocol that notifies assigned personnel to lock and verify.

Every lock is classified:

“Keyed Lock,” “Turn Lock,” “Remote Lock,” “No Lock,” or “Multi-Lock”

2. Windows

KeeperVault performs a full window audit:

Do they open? Do they lock? What kind of latch?

Physical vulnerabilities: old frames, damaged screens, shattered panes.

Optional status fields:

“Permanently Sealed,” “Operable,” “Break Risk,” “Escape-Only”

Can be tied to intrusion sensors if present — otherwise we create a manual inspection schedule.

3. Gates, Perimeter Fencing, Yard Access

Mapped per sector: front, rear, side, alley, loading dock, etc.

Each gate/fence classified:

“Openable,” “Secured,” “Camera-Covered,” “Obstructed”

KeeperVault will:

Assign gate duty (if needed)

Build a check-in/check-out log for physical gate opens

Sync with camera if you’ve got one (but not required)

🗝️ ACCESS CONTROL + LOCK MANAGEMENT

4. Key & Lock Tracking

KeeperVault creates a Key Log:

Each key is numbered and assigned (no matter how basic).

Duplicate keys tracked.

Lost keys trigger a flag + optional lock reassignments.

Can track master key holders, access chains, and lend-outs.

5. Physical Badge or ID Use (Manual or RFID)

If RFID: we’ll track entry logs by tag.

If Manual: KeeperVault builds a Visual Entry Register:

Time entered

By whom

For what purpose

Witness (if applicable)

Staff who bypass check-in get auto-flagged

🚨 INCIDENT RESPONSE & LOCKDOWN PROTOCOLS

6. Shooter / Threat Containment

Instant lockdown protocol:

If you have auto-lock doors: sealed remotely.

If not: alerts are pushed to designated staff to physically lock each assigned zone.

Staff check-ins confirm zones are sealed.

Map of facility displays:

🔐 Sealed

🟡 Pending

🔴 Breached

7. Break-In / After-Hours Alerting

KeeperVault maps:

After-hours access rules

Who is allowed and when

What motion (door, window, hallway) is considered a trigger

Even without cameras:

If someone enters and no schedule exists → red flag.

Daily log will show who was inside, when, and why.

🧰 TOOL + EQUIPMENT ROOM PROTECTION

8. Physical Inventory Room Control

Rooms like:

Supply closets

Tool sheds

Server cages

Equipment lockers

Each one is treated as a vault:

Entry is logged (digital or manual)

Items removed must match Inventory Access Logs

If a person enters without logging out a tool → they’re flagged

9. Vehicle Gate Protocol

If you have a gate (sliding, swinging, chain-link), KeeperVault will:

Assign open/close responsibility by shift

Log time of opening

Check that it was re-sealed

Alert if left open past threshold time

👥 PERSONNEL SAFETY + VISITOR OVERSIGHT

10. Visitor Protocols

KeeperVault logs:

Who entered

Who escorted them

What zone(s) they accessed

Time in / time out

If no escort is logged, system alerts primary admin.

11. Employee Exit Scans

At the end of shift:

KeeperVault checks that employees exited zones they were assigned to.

Optional: checklist prompt (lights off, tools returned, doors locked)

💾 OFFLINE MODE + MANUAL BACKUP

12. Fortress Mode (No Internet, No Power)

KeeperVault immediately:

Locks down protocol schedules

Switches to printed logs (for clipboards)

Activates LED signals (if installed)

Alerts via local dashboard (offline alert board or printed checklist)


Every action is logged and time-stamped — even offline.
