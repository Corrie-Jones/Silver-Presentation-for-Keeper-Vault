⚙️ Production & Operations — Core Overview

Purpose:
KeeperVault divides this domain into two working halves — Production and Operations — because together they form the living pulse of every organization.
Production builds. Operations sustains.
Both are precision-driven, interlocked through the same Vault backbone to ensure that when one moves, the other responds in perfect rhythm.

How It Works:
When you enter this section, you’ll see two paths: Production and Operations.
Choose one or both depending on your environment.

Production focuses on creation — manufacturing, assembly, fabrication, and digital output.

Operations focuses on control — process flow, resource management, and performance integrity.

KeeperVault keeps them autonomous yet synchronized, so that nothing stalls, overlaps, or disappears between departments
