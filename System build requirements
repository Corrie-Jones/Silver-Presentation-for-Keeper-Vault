**KeeperVault – System Build Requirements**  

Every KeeperVault deployment must meet baseline physical and power safeguards before activation. These requirements ensure your system stays operational and protected no matter what’s happening outside — whether online, offline, or when the grid itself is dark.  



**1 | Biometric Access – Required**  
All entry points to the KeeperVault environment — physical or digital — must include biometric verification.  

- If you already use biometric systems at your points of entry, you may continue using them as long as they will adapt to the Vault.  
- If not, KeeperVault USB fingerprint scanners are available. There must be one biometric device at *every* point of entry.  
- Clients who choose KeeperVault-provided scanners must supply an accurate count (which must match their system access map). The cost will be billed into their build.  



**2 | Backup Power – Required**  
Every KeeperVault build must have backup power of some kind — whether it’s generator, battery, solar, or wind-based. The length and type of backup is up to you.  

However, **we strongly recommend at least a 21-day power supply**.  

Because whether it’s an act of God — a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, flood, or any natural disaster that takes out everything around you — your system still needs to stay alive.  

As long as you can provide power — even from a Humvee battery — KeeperVault will continue to protect and defend your system until the grid comes back online.  

Just because your section loses power doesn’t mean hackers stop trying to get in. Your Vault will stay awake and on guard until full service returns.
